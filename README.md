### Goal: Analyze Abalone board game and find the proper initial setups 
> steps:
> 1.  Building the enviorment of board game.  
> 2.  Training model use Monte Carlo tree search(mcts) + reinforcement learning(RL).  
> 3.  Using existed initial setups to test our modelâ€™s accuracy.   
> 4.  Generate initial setup win rate is 50/50 which evaluated by trained model.

### 1.Enviorment:

### 2.MCTS+RL:
> 2.1 Behavior cloning
> 2.2 CNN
> 2.3 Policy network
> 2.4 Value network
> > generate a list of probability 
> 2.5 MCTS
> > 2.5.1 selection
> > 2.5.2 rollout
> > 2.5.3 backpropagation
