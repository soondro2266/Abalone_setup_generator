Goal: Analyze Abalone board game and find the proper initial setups.
1.Building the enviorment of board game.
2.Training model use Monte Carlo tree search(mcts) + reinforcement learning(RL).
3.Using existed initial setups to test our modelâ€™s accuracy. 
4.Generate initial setup win rate is 50/50 which is evaluated by trained model.
