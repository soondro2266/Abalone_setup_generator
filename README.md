### Goal: Analyze Abalone board game and find the proper initial setups 
> steps:
> 1.  Building the enviorment of board game.  
> 2.  Training model use Monte Carlo tree search(mcts) + reinforcement learning(RL).  
> 3.  Using existed initial setups to test our modelâ€™s accuracy.   
> 4.  Generate initial setup win rate is 50/50 which evaluated by trained model.
